# Analysis & Design (CS 300 Portfolio)

## Overview  
A portfolio repository for the CS 300 course: Data Structures & Algorithms. Contains projects focused on analyzing, designing, and implementing data structures, especially for course catalog / advising systems. Demonstrates how design decisions impact software correctness, performance, and maintainability.

## Technologies  
- C++  
- Standard Library (STL)  
- Tools: your preferred compiler (g++, clang, or Visual Studio)  
- File I/O, error handling, defensive programming  

## My Contributions & Highlights  
- Designed and implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) for managing course catalog with prerequisites, allowing for efficient lookup, insertion and ordering.  
- Performed runtime comparison between data structures (vectors, hash tables, BSTs) and used Big-O analysis to choose the optimal approach.  
- Handled edge cases: invalid input, malformed file paths, infinite loops. Implemented validation and error messaging.  
- Modular code organization: separated data structure logic from course-handling and file parsing to improve readability and future extensibility.

## How to Run / Explore  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Navigate to the folder housing the C++ files.  
3. Compile using a command such as `g++ ABCU_Advising_Program.cpp -o advisingProgram` (adjust based on filename).  
4. Run `./advisingProgram` and supply any input files if required.  
5. Review example usage in code, test with different input sizes to observe performance differences.

## What Recruiters Should Notice  
- Strong ability to analyze and compare algorithmic efficiency (Big-O reasoning).  
- Clean design thinking: separating modules, defensive error handling.  
- Code written with real constraints in mind (performance, user input validation, clear structure).  
- Readable code & robust testing / handling of edge cases.

## Optional Notes  
- Created as part of course assignment. All core logic & designs are my own.  
- Additional design documentation and reflective analysis are included in the repo (see `README.md`) for more academic detail.
